## This is a typical SOC set up, that you might find in an enterprise set up.
## On the left we have our resources that we will use to analyze alerts.
          - Log Management - This is where we can find network logs for the environment.
          - Case Management - This is where we can review our current open and closed cases.
          - Endpoint Security - This is where we can look at endpoints that are present in the network.
          - Email Security - This is where we can look at emails that are sent across the network.
          - Threat Intel - This is where we can cross-check threat intelligence by Domain, URL, Hash or IP
          - Sandbox - This is where we can access a Windows and a Linux vm set up with tools to analyze malware.
