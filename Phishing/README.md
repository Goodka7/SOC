After accepting ownership for the alert, I move to the Investigation Channel and create a case.

This allows me to access the playbook.
As always I copy all the details from the Investigation Channel into a notepad so I can aggregate all the data I will find during analysis into one area.

The playbook gives us a little warning about verifying the cause of the alert before escalating it to Tier 2 Support.
