# Broken Access Control

In this project, I will walkthrough the analysis of a SOC Alert, outlining typical steps I take to analyze and close alerts.
I will not be re-visiting descriptions from the SOC overview.

The first thing I do is open an alert that I have taken ownership of in the Investigation Channel.

This allows me to review key pieces of information that I will use to conduct a thorough analysis.
At this point, I always copy this information down and paste it in a notepad. This step is taken because I will be switching screens/tabs often and need to have all my gathered information available in one place so I dont need to switch back and forth between several screens/tabs.
This is also done because the playbook in this particular set up cannot be closed out of (or you'll have to start the playbook from scratch).

Now that I have all the basic information copied down, I will create a case.

This will take me to the Incident Details page, which provides some of the details from the first screen, but not as many, here we can start the playbook.

I will open a new tab/screen at this point so that I can keep the playbook active.
